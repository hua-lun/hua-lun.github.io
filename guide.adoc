== Introduction

Patient Dashboard is a dashboard built to make raw hospital data more readable.The dashboard
reads in clinical time-series data and produces various visualisation graphs.

There are number of issues with analysing clinical time-series data.Firstly, these data are often
large in quantity and rather disorganised.This causes a big cut in productivity and loss
in efficiency.Due to it's complex nature, it is difficult to find useful information.Rendering the
data "useless" or a chore to handle.

Given the above problems, the patient dashboard hopes to minimise the time spent on finding useful
data.This extra time can translate to data analysis or breakthroughs in clinical research.

The dashboard is written in Python 3. Plotly and Dash tools were used to create graphs and web
application.

The dashboard has 4 main features.These features help in data analysis and to make sense of the
raw data.

1. Filter based on time range
2. Multiple graph output
3. Frequency table for categorical variables (only limited to true / false data)
4. Box-plots for continuous variables

== Starting up the dashboard

To start the dashboard, key the following command inside terminal and hit enter:

[source]
----
python dashboard.py [metadata txt file] [data csv file]
----

If this is your first time using the dashboard, please use the sample files: `metadata.txt` and
`sample.csv` located in the root directory of `/patient-dashboard`

Next, you will be greeted with this message:

image::../images/terminal-message.png[]

The above shows that you've successfully launched the dashboard. As instructed, please go to
http://127.0.0.1:8050/ to open the dashboard in your web browser.

If you are unable to view the message, this means that your files are not in the correct format or the
wrong command was entered. If you are unable to troubleshoot the 'traceback' errors, please proceed to
<<fileformat.adoc#_acceptable_csv_file_format,fileformat.adoc>>
to understand the acceptable file format for the dashboard.

IMPORTANT: The current version is unable to start if there is no categorical data. Please use our
dummyCat.py to generate a column of categorical dummy data.

TIP: Use our fileChecker.py if your files are in the correct format.

== Using the dashboard
The application is a one page scrollable dashboard. All the functionality are found in that one page.
When you first open the app, you will be greeted with this page:

In this section, we will demonstrate how to the features respectively.

=== Graph functions

The graph function serves as the main part of the dashboard. Over here, you are able to visualise your
data into 1 or multiple graphs.

There are two types of graphs available.

1. Line graph (for continuous / time-series variables)
2. Bar Graph (for categorical / nominal variables)

The type of graph output is controlled according the description found in your `metadata.txt` file. For more
information on metadata and how it affects your graphs,
please go to <<fileformat.adoc#_acceptable_csv_file_format,fileformat.adoc>>.

==== 1 graph output

image::../images/1graph.png[]

To view the graph for 1 variable, these are the following steps:

1. Click anywhere in the box to view the dropdown menu. Next, select the variable of choice.
2. After selection, click the submit button to view the graph.

==== Multiple variables to graph output

image::../images/multiplegraph.png[]

To view the graph for 2 or more variables, these are the following steps:

1. After selecting 1 variable as shown in '1 graph output', choose another variable by clicking the
dropdown menu again.
2. Next, click the submit button to view the selected variables into 1 graph output.

==== Selecting by date

image::../images/select-date.png[]

To view a portion of the graph by selecting dates, these are the following steps:

1. After selecting variables, click on the left portion of the box to select the start date.
2. Next, click on the right portion of the box to select the end date.
3. Lastly, click the submit button to view the graph.

===== Using the datepicker

There are multiple parts in the datepicker.

a1. The two arrows allow you to select the month. The left arrow goes back a month while, the right arrow
goes forward a month.

a2. Below the 2 arrows, is the calendar portion. This is used to select the date.

TIP: Want to jump a year?
To get the selected date at a much faster pace, you can key in your date in the box
(marked by arrows 1 and 2)!

=== Frequency Table

The frequency table shows the statistics for categorical variables. 'Dummy' will be indicated if your
categorical data was created by our script.

Otherwise, the average, maximum and minimum value for each categorical variable will be shown.

Below is a sample of the frequency table:

=== Box-plot

For continuous variables, a box-plot will be shown for every variable. The 'Boxplots' button
is used to output the box-plots in the back-end. Currently, there is no functional use for the button in
this version.

Below is a sample of the box-plots:
